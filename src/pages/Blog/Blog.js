              Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature
              that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from
              scripts running in the browser. If your REST API's resources
              receive non-simple cross-origin HTTP requests, you need to enable
              CORS support.

              Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use
              SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your
              app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers,
              popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and
              Twitter, and more.

            <p>
              The private route component is similar to the public route, the
              only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If
              the user is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login
              page and the user can only access the authenticated routes If he
              is authenticated (Logged in).

              It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the
              server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on
              both frontend and backend. Node. js runs on chrome v8 engine which
              converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable,
              lightweight, fast, and data-intensive.
